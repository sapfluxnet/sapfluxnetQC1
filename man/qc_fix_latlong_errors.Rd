\title{Fixing sign errors in coordinates}
\usage{
qc_fix_latlong_errors(data, maps_folder = getwd(), sign_errors = TRUE,
  special_countries = FALSE, parent_logger = "test")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame with data coming from \code{\link{qc_check_coordinates}}
(with latitude, longitude, country and is_inside_country variables).}

\item{maps_folder}{Folder route where the maps are stored, by default the
working directory. It must be a character object and it must end
\bold{without} \code{/}.}

\item{sign_errors}{Logical indicating if sign errors must be checked and
fixed. If TRUE (default), \code{\link{qc_coord_sign_test}} is internally
called.}

\item{special_countries}{Logical indicating if the special approach to
countries having positive and negative coordinates must be used. See
\emph{Special countries} section for details.}
}
\value{
Same data frame provided, with coordinates tested and fixed
}
\description{
\code{qc_fix_latlong_errors} makes possible to fix known errors in latitude and
longitude coordinates, as exchanged signs.
}
\details{
This function calls to other internal functions in order to fix different
kinds of coordinates errors. At the moment, only exchanged signs in
coordinates errors are considered to be fixed.

After the fixes are applied, \code{\link{qc_check_coordinates}} is called to
update \code{is_inside_country} variable.
}
\section{Sign errors}{

If \code{sign_errors = TRUE} is specified, \code{\link{qc_coord_sign_test}} is
called to establish possible sign error and, if any, they are fixed. This fix
can be done with or without special countries (see next section)
}

\section{Special countries}{

There are special countries where border coordinates for longitude, latitude
or both have negative and positive values. In this case, the normal approach
of \code{qc_coord_sign_test} is not appropriate, and several tests involving
the internal use of \code{\link{qc_check_coordinates}} must be made. If
\code{special_countries = TRUE} is specified, then tests are made trying to
dilucidate if only a change in the sign of one, latitude or longitude, is
needed or, in the contrary, changing both of them is needed. There is one
case that can not be covered by this approach: when changing sign of one of
the coordinates \bold{AND} changing both coordinates seem to fix the issue,
as the correct option can not be assured.
