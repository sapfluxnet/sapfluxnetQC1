\title{Coordinates sign test}
\usage{
qc_coord_sign_test(data, maps_folder = getwd(), special_countries = FALSE,
  parent_logger = "test")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame with data coming from \code{\link{qc_check_coordinates}}
(with latitude, longitude, country and is_inside_country variables).}

\item{maps_folder}{Folder route where the maps are stored, by default the
working directory. It must be a character object and it must end
\bold{without} \code{/}.}

\item{special_countries}{Logical indicating if the special approach to
countries having positive and negative coordinates must be used. See
\emph{Special countries} section for details.}
}
\value{
Same data frame provided, with a two new columns, \code{lat_changed}
  and \code{long_changed}, two logicals indicating if the coordinates are
  sign exchanged
}
\description{
\code{qc_coord_sign_test} is an internal function to test if site coordinates
signs are interchanged. It's needed by \code{\link{qc_fix_latlong_errors}}
function.
}
\details{
Country coordinates sign is established by this function and testing if
provided site coordinates are correct is made.
}
\section{Special countries}{

There are special countries where border coordinates for longitude, latitude
or both have negative and positive values. In this case, the normal approach
of \code{qc_coord_sign_test} is not appropriate, and several tests involving
the internal use of \code{\link{qc_check_coordinates}} must be made. If
\code{special_countries = TRUE} is specified, then tests are made trying to
dilucidate if only a change in the sign of one, latitude or longitude, is
needed or, in the contrary, changing both of them is needed. There is one
case that can not be covered by this approach: when changing sign of one of
the coordinates \bold{AND} changing both coordinates seem to fix the issue,
as the correct option can not be assured.
