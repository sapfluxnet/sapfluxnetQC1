In order to identify the state of the data in the `Data` folder a status file
is present in all sites folders. In this file is located all the information
relative to the different steps of data processing for the folder datasets.

## Format

Choosen format is [yaml](http://www.yaml.org/) and the integration with R is
done by the `yaml` package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/yaml/index.html).

This format is choosen by several reasons:

  1. Easy integration with R
  1. Actively developed
  1. Already in use in other packages/processes (**RMarkdown**).

## Status file characteristics

  + Location:  
    Each status file resides in the root of the site data folder. For example,
    for the `XXX_XXX_XXX` site, the location is `Data/XXX_XXX_XXX/status.file`
  
  + Name:  
    Each file is named by the site code plus `_status.yaml` to indicate the
    nature of the file
  
  + Content:  
    Content of the file is in the `yaml` format. See content section below.  
    

## File content

QC
  : Field indicating if Quality Check is already done. Two subfields:
  
    + DONE: logical indicating if QC is done
    + DATE: character indicating the date in which QC was done

LVL1
  : Field indicating if data is stored in the `Level_1` data folder. Two subfields:
  
    + STORED: logical indicating if Lvl1 data was stored

LVL2
  : Field indicating if data is stored in the `Level_2` data folder. Two subfields:
