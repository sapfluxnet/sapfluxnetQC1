In order to identify the state of the data in the `Data` folder a status file
is present in all sites folders. In this file is located all the information
relative to the different steps of data processing for the folder datasets.

## Format

Chosen format is [yaml](http://www.yaml.org/) and the integration with R is
done by the `yaml` package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/yaml/index.html).

This format is chosen by several reasons:

  1. Easy integration with R
  1. Actively developed
  1. Already in use in other packages/processes (**RMarkdown**).

## Status file characteristics

  + Location:  
    Each status file resides in the root of the site data folder. For example,
    for the `XXX_XXX_XXX` site, the location is `Data/XXX_XXX_XXX/status.file`
  
  + Name:  
    Each file is named by the site code plus `_status.yaml` to indicate the
    nature of the file
  
  + Content:  
    Content of the file is in the `yaml` format. See content section below.  
    

## File content

QC
  : Field indicating if Quality Check is already done. Two sub-fields:
  
    + DONE: logical indicating if QC is done
    + DATE: character indicating the date in which QC was done

LVL1
  : Field indicating if data is stored in the `Level_1` data folder. Two sub-fields:
  
    + STORED: logical indicating if Lvl1 data was stored
    + DATE: character indicating the date in which storage was done

LVL2
  : Field indicating if data is stored in the `Level_2` data folder. Two sub-fields:
  
    + STORED: logical indicating if Lvl2 data was stored
    + DATE: character indicating the date in which storage was done

### Example

XXX_XXX_XXX_status.yaml

```
# XXX_XXX_XXX_status.yaml

QC:
  DONE: yes
  DATE: '2016-05-29'
LVL1:
  STORED: yes
  DATE: '2016-05-30'
LVL2:
  STORED: no
  DATE: ~
```

## Getting and setting statuses

There is two functions to retrieve and set the status of a site:

  1. `df_get_status`. In charge of load the actual state of a site. Executing
     this function in the RStudio Server instance prints a list with the
     elements we saw before. See function help (`?df_get_status`) for more
     info.
  
  2. `df_set_status`. This function allows modification of the status file by
     providing a list for each element to modify. See function help
     (`?df_set_status`) for more info.

## Resetting a site

Sometimes, after completing needed manual changes, status must be resetted to
allow performing the QC process again. Status can be retrieved and changed
by the functions explained above, but doing only this can lead to errors.
When resetting a site, not only the status file must be changed, also old data
present in `received_data` and `Data/si_code/Lvl_1` folders must be renamed to
avoid conflicts in the new QC. So, in the case of a site reset, we need to use
the `df_reset_data_status`, which is in charge of setting the new status, but
also of renaming old data.
