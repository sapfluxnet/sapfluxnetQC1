# Introduction

Data flow starts the moment a contributor send his/her data to the system.
This vignette aims to document this data flow and the functions of the
`sapfluxnetQC1` package that make it possible.  

Figure 1 summarises the project folder tree:

## Received_data folder

Each dataset submitted by contributors starts in the `Received_data` folder.
Here data is stored temporarily until it is moved to the
`Data/site_code/Accepted` folder by executing `df_received_to_accepted` function
in the `sapfluxnetQC1` package.

## `df_received_to_accepted`

Figure 2 summarises the reasoning behind `df_received_to_accepted` function:

Site codes are extracted from file names, and the `Data` subfolders specific for
the sites are created. A warning is raised if folders already exists. If it is
the case, also the previous existence of the files is checked, and if they
exist, another warning is raised and the copy proccess is stopped.  
If files do not exist, they are copied to the `Data/site_code/Accepted` folder,
and a md5 checksum is made to ensure the integrity of the copies. Again, if
the checksum fails, a warning is raised and the proccess stops.  
Finally, depending on the value of the `remove` argument of the function, the
files in te `Received_data` folders are dropped (with a message) or not
(with a warning). All the proccess is logged at message level (messages,
warnings and errors).

## QC process

Once the data is in the accepted folder, data quality checks must be run to
ensure data suitability.
QC is started with `qc_start_process`. This function checks all data status
files, and performs the QC on those without the QC **DONE** flag.

Last step in the QC process is data flow to `Lvl_1` folder, indicating that
the data has been checked. This step is performed by the `df_accepted_to_lvl1`.  
function:

<img src="df_accepted_to_lvl1.svg" alt="Fig. 2" style="width: 500px;"/>

Data will stay in `Lvl_1` folder until the report produced is studied. If manual
or contributor side changes are necessary, those are made and the QC process
is re-runned (after changing the flags in the status file). If all is correct,
data can be moved to `Lvl_2` (yet to do).
